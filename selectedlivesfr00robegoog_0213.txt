186 NOTES.

10. iterum consulem: this should read (Gracchum) bis con-
sulem and below Marcellum quiutum consulem, for Gracchus was
killed nster the expiration of his second, Marcellus during his
fifth consulship.

10. in Lucanis: join with sustulit; see on per ligures, p. 69,1. 6.

10. absens: i.e., through his brother Mago.

13. Longum est: it would be tedicus, an expression of propriety
taking the indicative in Latin, but trans. as if the subjunct.
(G. 311c).

14. ex quo: ut ex οῦ.

15. quamdiu . . . posuit: he was not defeated in Italy (if
we accept Nola). The rest of the statement is absurd.

18. defensum: cf. deliberatum, p. r, l. ro.

18. revocatus: 203.

19. P. scipionem: i.e., P. cornelius Scipio, to which the

. agnomen Africanus was added after his defeat of Hannibal. He

conquered all Spain between 210 and 206. In 204 he went over
to Africa from Sicily and won a great battle near Utica, which
occasioned the recall of Hannibal.

22. impraesentiarum: an adverb equivalent to iu praesentia,
p. 8, l. 6; a colloquial expression probably from iu praesentia
rerum. Ι

23· bellum componere: cs. bellum compositorum, p. 37, l. 20.

24. In conloquium convenit, etc. .· a confermce is agreed upon ;
em terms they did not agree (lit. terms did not meet).

2 5. Post id factum: after tlris took place, lit. after this deed.

26. Zamam: this was southwest of Carthage. It is thought
that Naraggara, which lay fifty miles to the west oi Zama, was
the scene of the battle ; the armies had encamped there prior to
the colloquy. Hadrumetum was not over one hundred miles
from Zama, one hundred and fifty from Naraggara; hence the
statement trecenta milia is an exaggeration.

Papo 71. abest ab Zama: ab is used even with names of
towns when the distance from one place to another is stated.

8. acerrime occupatus: most actively engaged.
