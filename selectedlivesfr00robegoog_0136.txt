26. testularum suffragiis: the so-called ostracism. After the
banishment of Hippias, the Atheniens, in order to prevent the
rise of tyrants, hit upon a plan by which men whose influence
and power seemed dangerous to liberty, might be exiled for a
term of years (originally ten, later fixed at five), with no loss of
property or honor3 6000 votes for this purpose must be cast to
bring it about, and, as they wrote the name of the obnoxious
citizen on potsherds (ὄστρακα = testulae), they named this action
ostracism‚ or the judgment of the potsherds.

with the Persian king. After his death letters were found in his

that the king is of the same blood as his subjecta, which need
not be true of the second phrase.

4. proditionis: with damnatus eat, not with crimine.

7. Argis: plural as in the case of many ancient towns, prob
tbly originally adjectives‚ ag, the Argivo villages; the Athenian
villages; then becoming Argi and Athenae. Cf Argis, l. 1.

8. iis: sibi would be more regular, but as Nepos has already
used se in this clause referring to Themistocles the subject of
animadvertisset, he could hardly avoid the change of pronoun.

10. Molossum=1t1010sstrum They lived originally in the
interior of Epirus, but later possessed the whole country. Their
kings claimed descent from Neoptolemus, son oi hchihxes.
