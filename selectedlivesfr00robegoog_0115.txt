88 NOTES.

2. oppidd: urbe would be better, 'as he means Athens5 there
was a village as well as a plain of Marathon. Oppidum is rarely
used of a capital city; once by Livy, and several times by Nepos.
The distance is actually 22 miles by the shortest road.

2. passuum: not by our reckoning; pace with us is the same
as step, the space included between the feet in walking. The
Roman pace was double ours‚ the space passed over between the
footfalls of the same foot. Yet the Roman mile was somewhat
shorter than ours.

3. tumultu: used by the Romans particularly of a rebellion
ι or insurrection right at home, and consequently dangerous.

Hence it is chosen here to lay stress upon the suddenness and
danger of this bellum. ,

4. Lacedaemoniis: as the most powerful state in Greece; the
Argives alone of the Peloponnesians did not follow the Lace-
daemonian standard in war. Both Scythians and Ionians had
vainly appealed to the Spartans for help against the Persians.

6. qui: the relative is attracted into agreement with its predi-
cate appositive hemerodromoe, instead of being quod to conform
to its antecedent generis.

6. hemerodromoe: Greek noun of second deciens. (G. 43, d;
H· 54, note 1). Keep the same word in English. The perform-
ances of some of these runners were most extraordinary. After
the battle of Plataea, one of them ran from the battlefield to
Delphi and back (perhaps 112 miles altogether) in one day. In
the present instance Phidippus reached Sparta (more than 12 5
miles distant) on the second day.

8. auxilio: why abl? (G. 243, e; H. 4¹4, lu).

8. creant: why present? Cf revertitur, p. 2, l. 21.

8. praetores: not comparable to the Roman officials of class-
ical times, but as in the earliest use of the word from its ety-
mology, leaders, generals ; see group 1-; Ascon. on Cic. Verres r,
14, says: Veteres, omnes magistratus quibus pareret exercitus,
praeterea appellaverunt. The qui . . . praeessent seems to be
added to prevent misunderstanding of Nepos’ use of the term.
Ten generals were chosen yearly.
