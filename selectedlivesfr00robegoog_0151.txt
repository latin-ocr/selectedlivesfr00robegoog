promontory opposite Sarnos, was won by the Greeks under Leo·
tychitles the Spartan on the same day on which the battle of
Plataea was fought (479), and Cimon had nothing to do with it.

from the Persians and held it against fierce attacks. 'The site of
Amphipolis lay farther up the river, and though Cimon personally
did not take part. the first attempt to establish a colony there
