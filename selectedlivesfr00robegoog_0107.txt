’ 80 NOTES.

Paua 1. 1. Miltiades, (liminis filius, Atheniensis: these
words serve as a title, but are constructed with the first sentence.
In many of the “Lives” Nepos disconnects the first few words
from what follows and gives us a title in quite modern fashion.
Cf, eg„ the beginning oi Themistocles, Alcibiades, Epaminondas.

r. Ciminis filius: a mistake on Nepos’ part, who confounds
the two men, uncle and nephew, bearing the same name. The
founder oi the colony went to the Chersonesus some iorty years
before the hero oi Marathon, who was the son of Cimon. The
younger Miltiades succeeded his brother Stesagoras, who had
succeeded the elder Miltiades, their uncle. The followingis the

genealogy :

Cypselus = the same wile = Stesagoras I.
