native lond and dependent on the leelp os foreignera lte never
abandoned leis feeling os hostility sor the Romam ; animis bollire:
lit. to wage war in leeart.

16. nam: this should introduce a proof of the preceding
statement, vin numquam destiterit animis bellare, etc.; the sen-
tence would then read nam Antiochum, qui . . . potentissimus rex
fuit . . . incendit. Nepos is so intent on emphasizing the great-
ness ot Antiochus that he breaks up what follows nain into two
sentences, leaving for the following sentence incendit, the verb
which should depend directly on the nam.

on some word understood, as dicam, J will say (G. 317c3 H. 499,

to the Arabic Guli (the Red Sea of today), to a portion of the

confined to the Arabic Guli, but occasionally was used in its
earlier sense, as it is here, of the sea between Arabia and India.
