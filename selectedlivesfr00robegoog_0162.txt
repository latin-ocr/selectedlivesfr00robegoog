places it on the authority of the accusers (G. 321; H. 516‚11.).

18. reum: in, no formal charge was brought till he had gone;
the talk against him in the assembly just before his departure
was not a legal accusation. Reus means one having to do with
a res which, technically‚ was an action at law ; then it was limited

Thurii was an Athenian colony in lower Italy.
