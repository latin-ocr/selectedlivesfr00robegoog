Nouus 155

z. Diomedonte: abl. govemed hythe prep. odram, which some-
times follows its case.

3. Nihil: not at oll ; an emphatic ndn; an adverbial accus.

3· pecdnia: abl. of separation following opus (G. 243 e, but
see also footnote3 H. 414, IV).

4. gratiis: the abl. plural of gratia used adverbially; later
contracted into gratis, which has been adopted into English.

5. sinautem: autem strengthens the adversative force oi sin. ,

6. Namque . . . ciritite: For I will· not surrender (accipere,
lit. accept) my lovesor my country iu exchougesor (pro) uu weolllz
of tle world ; this causes the object of the verb and the word
governed 'by pro to exchange places, but seems to express the
idea naturally. ⁸

9. egredere: (egredior) pres. imperative pass.; a deponent ·

verb occasions no confusion, but remember that in fully inflected
verbs the present infinitivo act. and the present imperative pass.
(sing.) have exactly the same form.

12. facis: the action is to be immediate (confestim), andis
not regarded as future though tradam stands in the apodosis;
by rule we should have feceris, which in English oddly enough
we regularly translate by the‘ present. Cf Cic. Verr. 4, 85:
moriere virgis (you shall be stogged to death) nisi mihi sIgnum
traditur.

13. toto: adv.

¹3· exiret: we should expect liceret sibi exire, as below liceret.

regularly used in connection with the second person (G. 1⁴02c;
H. 450).
