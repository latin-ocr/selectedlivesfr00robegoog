vi ‚ PREFACE.

recognition, the present edition has be'en limited to nine
of the “Lives,'' selected with special reference to their
historical value. In the biographies of Miltiades, Themis-
tocleS, Cimon, and Alcibiades we get glimpses of Athens
and Athenian lifeand spi'rit in the most interesting period '
of the development of the state. In those of Pausanias
and Agesilaus, Nepos shows us something oi the peculiar
Spartan government, and draws a contrast between the
characters of two of the most famous Spartan kings. In
the story of Pelopidas and Epaminondas we discover how
it was that Thebes was enabled to secure a prominent
place among the peoples ot Greece. Lastly the story of

Hannibal, dealing with his vow, his hatred of Rome,
his marvelous ability as a general, the iear with which

he inspired the Romans, is preeminently worthy to be
included in any selection of representative lives from
Nepos.

The text is, with a few minor alterations, that of Halm,
the orthography is made uniiorm with that of the other
books in this series In response to many requests the
quantity of long vowels has been indicated throughout the
book. In determining quantitieS, and also in matters of
etymology, Lewis’ Elementary Dictionary has been for the
most part, though not invariably, followed.

The synonyms placed at the foot of each page of text,
and the word-groups printed just before the vocabulary‚
will, it is hoped, be of service in enlarging the pupil’s
vocabulary and training him in his earliest reading to
cultivate the power oi associating words of like origin.
